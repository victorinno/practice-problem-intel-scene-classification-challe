# About Practice Problem Intel Scene Classification Challenge
There has been a tremendous increase in the applications of computer vision. The applications of CV range from smart cameras and video surveillance to robotics, transportation and more.

Intel remains at the forefront to enable developers and data scientists build useful CV applications optimised for Intel processor architecture.

We encourage the participants to use the new OpenVINO™ toolkit by Intel. Short for Open Visual Inference & Neural Network Optimisation, the OpenVINO™ toolkit (formerly Intel® CV SDK) contains optimised OpenCV and OpenVX libraries, deep learning code samples, and pre-trained models to enhance computer vision development.  It’s validated on 100+ open source and custom models, and is available absolutely free. You can get started with the toolkit from the resources provided at this link
